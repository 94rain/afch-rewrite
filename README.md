============

v0.1 / "Exploding Fireball"

A tool for reviewing Articles for Creation submissions on the English Wikipedia, rewritten using clear, object-oriented JavaScript with a focus on killing bloat while adding value.

Currently mainly being developed by @theopolisme; not at all ready for prime time.

[MediaWiki:Gadget-afch.js](https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Gadget-afch.js)@testwiki is theoretically a working copy of the rewrite script, although it is also used for development purposes and may therefore be unstable at times. (`?debug=true` is your friend!)
