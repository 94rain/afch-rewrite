============

**v0.2 Egalitarian Elephant**

A tool for reviewing Articles for Creation submissions on the English Wikipedia, rewritten using clear, object-oriented JavaScript with a focus on killing bloat while adding value.

Currently mainly being developed by [@theopolisme](https://github.com/theopolisme).

### Using

On testwiki, [MediaWiki:Gadget-afch.js](https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Gadget-afch.js) is an updated copy of the script used for development purposes.

Feel free to give it a run by adding `importScript('MediaWiki:Gadget-afch.js')` to your [common.js](https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/common.js) page there, but bear in mind that the rewrite is still alpha software.
